I want to build a modern, visually clean yet elegant website for a pharmaceutical company named Jambul Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., inspired by the clean design language of Framer, with smooth animations (like Framer Motion), clear hierarchy, and blue & white as the primary brand colors (deep royal blue for buttons, highlights, icons; white background or light gradients).

The company operates from India, with its pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Ghiloth, Rajasthan, and HQ in New Delhi. It competes with companies like Sterile India, and aims to project trust, regulatory strength, and innovation.
